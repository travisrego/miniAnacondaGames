It works on a simple idea of saving the possible options in an array and randomly selecting an option from the array. 
Then it grabs the answer of the user and compares it with the computer's answer. If they are equal, it is a tie. If the user wins, it adds one point to the user's score. If the computer wins, it adds one point to the computer's score. The game continues until the user or computer reaches the best of user defined round.
